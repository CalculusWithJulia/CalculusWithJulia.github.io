<h1>Area between two curves</h1><p>The definite integral gives the "signed" area between the function $f(x)$ and the $x$-axis over $[a,b]$. Conceptually, this is the area between two curves, $f(x)$ and $g(x)=0$. More generally, this integral:</p>$$~
\int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) dx
~$$
<p>can be interpreted as the "signed" area between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ over $[a,b]$. If on this interval $[a,b]$ it is true that $f(x) \geq g(x)$, then this would just be the area, as seen in this figure. The rectangle in the figure has area: $(f(a)-g(a)) \cdot (b-a)$ which could be a term in a left Riemann sum of the integral of $f(x) - g(x)$:</p>    <div id="467ca014-38d9-4ebb-a898-d32b4919ed9c" style="width:600px;height:400px;"></div>

<p>For the figure, we have $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, $g(x)= x^2$ and $[a,b] = [1/4, 3/4]$. The shaded area is then found by:</p>$$~
\int_{1/4}^{3/4} (x^{1/2} - x^2) dx = (\frac{x^{3/2}}{3/2} - \frac{x^3}{3})\big|_{1/4}^{3/4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} -\frac{7}{32}.
~$$
<h2>Examples</h2><p>Find the area bounded by the line $y=2x$ and the curve $y=2 - x^2$.</p><p>We can plot to see the area in question:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">using Plots
f(x) = 2 - x^2

<p>There is a single interval when $f \geq g$ and this can be found algebraically using basic trigonometry, or numerically:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">a,b = fzeros(x -> f(x) - g(x), 0, 2pi)  # pi/4, 5pi/4
QuadGK.quadgk(x -> f(x) - g(x), a, b)[1]</pre>
<pre class="output">
2.8284271247461903</pre>

<h5>Example</h5><p>Find the area between $x^n$ and $x^{n+1}$ over $[0,1]$ for $n=1,2,\dots$.</p><p>We have on this interval $x^n \geq x^{n+1}$, so the integral can be found symbolically through:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">using SymPy
x, n = symbols("x,n", real=true, positive=true)

together(ex)</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">
$$\frac{1}{\left(n + 1\right) \left(n + 2\right)}$$</div>

<p>Based on this answer, what is the value of this </p>$$~
\frac{1}{2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{3\cdot 4} + \frac{1}{4\cdot 5} + \cdots?
~$$
<p>This should should be no surprise, given how the areas computed carve up the area under the line $y=x^1$ over $[0,1]$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">summation(1/(n+1)/(n+2), (n, 1, oo))</pre>
<div class="well well-sm">

<p>For concreteness, let $f(x) = 2-x^2$ and $[a,b] = [-1, 1/2]$, as in the figure. Then the area of the triangle can be computed through:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = 2 - x^2
a,b = -1, 1/2
c = (a +b)/2
function secant(f, x1, x2)
   m = (f(x2) - f(x1)) / (x2 - x1)
   x -> f(x1) + m * (x-x1)
end

sac, sab, scb = secant(f, a,c), secant(f, a,b), secant(f, c,b)
f1(x) = min(sac(x), scb(x))
f2(x) = sab(x)

val1 = QuadGK.quadgk(x -> f1(x) - f2(x), a, b)[1]</pre>
<pre class="output">
0.421875</pre>

<p>As we needed three secant lines, we created a function to generate them. Once that was done, we used the <code>max</code> function to facilitate integrating over the top bounding curve, alternatively, we could break the integral over $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$.</p><p>The area of the parabolic segment is more straightforward.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">val2 = QuadGK.quadgk(x -> f(x) - f2(x), a, b)[1]</pre>
<pre class="output">
0.5625000000000001</pre>

<p>Finally, if Archimedes was right, this relationship should bring about $0$ (or something within round-off error):</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">val1 * 4/3 - val2</pre>
<pre class="output">

<p>There must be another zero, though it is hard to see from the graph over $[0,10]$, as $0^4=0$ and $e^0=1$, so the polynomial must cross below the exponential to the left of $5$. (Otherwise, plotting over $[0,2]$ will clearly reveal the other zero.) We now find these intersection points numerically and then integrate:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">a,b = fzeros(x -> f(x) - g(x), 0, 10)

<p>For a given $m$, the area is found after computing $b$, the intersection point. We express this as a function of $m$ for later reuse:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">B(m) = maximum(fzeros(x -> sin(x) - m*x, 0, pi))
a = 0

<pre class="output">
0.4207978950529467</pre>

<pre class="output">

<h4>Integrating in different directions</h4><p>The last example suggested integrating in the $y$ variable. This could have more explanation.</p><p>It has been noted that different symmetries can aid in computing integrals through their interpretation as areas. For example, if $f(x)$ is odd, then $\int_{-b}^b f(x)dx=0$ and if $f(x)$ is even, $\int_{-b}^b f(x) dx = 2\int_0^b f(x) dx$.</p><p>Another symmetry of the $x-y$ plane is the reflection through the line $y=x$. This has the effect of taking the graph of $f(x)$ to the graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ and vice versa. Here is an example with $f(x) = x^3$ over $[-1,1]$.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = x^3

<p>Suppose we wanted the area in the first quadrant between this graph, the $y$ axis and the line $y=1$. What to do? With the problem "flipped" through the $y=x$ line, this would just be $\int_0^1 x^3dx$. Rather than mentally flipping the picture to integrate, instead we can just integrate in the $y$ variable. That is, the area is  $\int_0^1 y^3 dy$. The mental picture for Riemann sums would be have the approximating rectangles laying flat and as a function of $y$, are given a length of $y^3$ and height of "$dy$".</p><p>For a less trivial problem, consider the area between $x = y^2$ and $x = 2-y$ in the first quadrant.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">ys = linspace(0, 2)

A large scale work. How much does it weigh? Approximately?</p><p>Let's try to answer that with an educated guess. The right most figure looks to be about 1/5th the total amount. So if we estimate that piece and multiply by 5 we get a good guess. That part looks like an area of metal bounded by two quadratic polynomials. If we compute that area in square inches, then multiply by an assumed thickness of one inch, we have the cubic volume. The density of galvanized steel is 7850 kg/$m^3$ which we convert into pounds/in$^3$ via:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">7850 * 2.2 * (1/39.3)^3</pre>
