Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function over the interval $[a,b]$ with $a < b$.

The average value of $f$ over $[a,b]$ is defined by:

$$~
\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx.
~$$

If $f$ is a constant, this is just the contant value, as would be
expected. If $f$ is *piecewise* linear, then this is the weighted
average of these constants.

## Examples

##### Average velocity

The average velocity between times $a < b$, is simply the
change in position during the time interval divided by the change in
time. In notation, this would be $(x(b) - x(a)) / (b-a)$. If $v(t) =
x'(t)$ is the velocity, then by the second part of the fundamental
theorem of calculus, we have, in agreement with the definition above,
that:

$$~
\text{average velocity} = \frac{x(b) - x(a)}{b-a} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b v(t) dt.
~$$


The average speed is the change in *total* distance over time, which is given by

$$~
\text{average speed} =  \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b \lvert v(t)\rvert dt.
~$$



Let $\bar{v}$ be the average velocity. Then we have $\bar{v}
\cdot(b-a) = x(b) - x(a)$, or the change in position can be written as
a constant ($\bar{v}$) times the time, as though we had a constant
velocity.  This is an old intuition.

comments on the special case known to scholars at Merton
College around 1350 that the distance traveled by an object under
uniformly increasing velocity starting at $v_0$ and ending at $v_t$ is
equal to the distance traveled by an object with constant velocity of
$(v_0 + v_t)/2$.

##### Example

What is the average value of $f(x)=\sin(x)$ over $[0, \pi]$?

$$~
\text{average} = \frac{1}{\pi-0} \int_0^\pi \sin(x) dx = \frac{1}{\pi} (-\cos(x)) \big|_0^\pi = \frac{2}{\pi}
~$$

Visually, we have:

```

plotly()
plot(sin, 0, pi)
plot!(x -> 2/pi)
```

##### Example

What is the average value of the function $f$ which is $1$ between
$[0,3]$, $2$ between $(3,5]$ and $1$ between $(5,6]$?

Though not continuous, $f(x)$ is integrable as it contains only jumps. The integral from $[0,6]$ can be computed with geometry: $3\cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 14$. The average then is $14/(6-0) = 7/3$.

##### Example

What is the average value of the function $e^{-x}$ between $0$ and $\log(2)$?

$$~
\text{average} = \frac{1}{\log(2) - 0} \int_0^{\log(2)} e^{-x} dx
= \frac{1}{\log(2)} (-e^{-x}) \big|_0^{\log(2)}
= -\frac{1}{\log(2)} (\frac{1}{2} - 1)
= \frac{1}{2\log(2)}.
~$$

Visualizing, we have

```
plot(x -> exp(-x), 0, log(2))
plot!(x -> 1/(2*log(2)))
```

## The mean value theorem for integrals

If $f(x)$ is assumed integrable, the average value of $f(x)$ is
defined, as above. Re-expressing gives that there exists a $K$ with

$$~
K \cdot (b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) dx.
~$$

When we assume that $f(x)$ is continuous, we can describe $K$ as a value in the range of $f$:

> **The mean value theorem for integrals**: Let $f(x)$ be a continuous
> function on $[a,b]$ with $a < b$. Then there exists $c$ with $a \leq c \leq b$ with
> $$~ f(c) \cdot (b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) dx.~$$

The proof comes from the intermediate value theorem and the extreme
value theorem. Since $f$ is continuous on a closed interval, there
exists values $m$ and $M$ with $f(c_m) = m \leq f(x) \leq M=f(c_M)$,
for some $c_m$ and $c_M$ in the interval $[a,b]$. Since $m \leq f(x) \leq M$, we must have:

$$~
m \cdot (b-a) \leq K\cdot(b-a) \leq M\cdot(b-a).
~$$

So in particular $K$ is in $[m, M]$. But $m$ and $M$ correspond to
values of $f(x)$, so by the intermediate value theorem, $K=f(c)$ for
some $c$ that must lie in between $c_m$ and $c_M$, which means as well
that it must be in $[a,b]$.

##### Proof of second part of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The mean value theorem is exactly what is needed to prove formally the
second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Again, suppose
$f(x)$ is continous on $[a,b]$ with $a < b$. For any $a < x < b$, we
define $F(x) = \int_a^x f(u) du$. Then the derivative of $F$ is $f$.

Let $h>0$. Then consider the forward difference $(F(x+h) -
F(x))/h$. Rewriting gives:

$$~
\frac{\int_a^{x+h} f(u) du - \int_a^x f(u) du}{h}  =\frac{\int_x^{x+h} f(u) du}{h} = f(\xi(h)).
~$$

The value $\xi(h)$ is just the $c$ corresponding to a given value in $[x, x+h]$
guaranteed by the mean value theorem.  We only know that $x \leq \xi(h) \leq x+h$. But
this is plenty---it says that $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0+} \xi(h) =
x$. Using the fact that $f$ is continuous and the known properties of
limits of compositions of functions this gives $\lim_{h \rightarrow
0+} f(\xi(h)) = f(x)$. But this means that the (right) limit of the
secant line expression exists and is equal to $f(x)$, which is what we
want to prove. Repeating a similar argument when $h < 0$, finishes the proof.


The basic notion used is simply that for small $h$, this expression is well
approximated by the left Riemann sum taken over $[x, x+h]$:

$$~
f(\xi(h)) \cdot h = \int_x^{x+h} f(u) du.
~$$
