Create a "bookdown" file


# Steps:

* Within the various subdirectories, do the usual to create the html pages. These generate the *.md files from the *.mmd files

* The *.md files are linked into the `bookdown` directory. From that directory, the `process.jl` file will generate *.Rmd files from the $.md files.

* The *.Rmd files can be stiched together (built) with RStudio, or from the command line.



# TODO: some features need updating:

Reel + Gadfly -- does it work with v0.6?

The "popup" stuff isn't working (See more). This is lightly used and could be reformatted.

DataFrames has odd error, which goes away after second running
