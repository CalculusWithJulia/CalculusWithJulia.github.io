Süss — German for “sweet” — is an interactive widget that allows you to tweak the algebra and customize the heart to your souls’s delight. It was created for Valentine’s Day by Imaginary, a nonprofit organization in Berlin that designs open-source mathematics programs and exhibitions.

You can stretch and squeeze the heart by moving the two left-most sliders, which change the “a” and “b” parameters; the right-most slider zooms in and out. Better yet, canoodle directly with Süss’s equation and engage in the dialectical interplay between algebra and geometry. (Change that final z³ to a z² to see the heart in its underwear.)

```
(x^2+((1+b)*y)^2+z^2-1)^3-x^2*z^3-a*y^2*z^3
