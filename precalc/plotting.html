<h1>The Graph of a Function</h1><p>A univariate function, such as $f(x) = 1 - x^2/2$, can be thought of in many different ways. For example, </p><ul>
<li><p>It can be represented through a rule of what it does to $x$, as above. This is useful for computing numeric values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>it can be interpreted verbally, as in <em>square</em> $x$, take half then <em>subtract</em> from one. This can give clarity to what the function does.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can be thought of in terms of its properties: a polynomial, continuous, $U$-shaped, $\dots$</p>
</li>
<li><p>it can be visualized graphically. This is useful for seeing the qualitative behaviour of a function.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The graph of a univariate function is just a set of points in the Cartesian plane. These points come from the relation $(x,f(x))$ that defines the function. Operationally, a sketch of the graph will consider a handful of such pairs and then the rest of the points will be imputed.</p><p>For example, a typical approach to plot $f(x) = 1 - x^2/2$ would be to choose some values for $x$ and find the corresponding values of $y$. This might be organized in a "T"-table:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia"> x | y
-- | --
-2 | -1
-1 | 1/2
 0 | 1
 1 | 1/2
 2 | -1
 3 | -7/2</pre>
<p>These pairs would be plotted in a Cartesian plane and then connected with curved lines. A good sketch is aided by knowing ahead of time that this function describes a parabola which is curving downwards.</p><p>It is important to note that this sketch would not include <em>all</em> the pairs $(x,f(x))$, as their extent is infinite.</p><h2>Graphing a function with Julia</h2><p><code>Julia</code> has several different options for rendering graphs, all in external packages. We will focus in these notes on the <code>Plots</code> package, which provides a common interface to several different plotting backends. </p><p>As such, we begin by loading the <code>Plots</code> package (which must have been installed on the system at some point with a command such as <code>Pkg.add&#40;&quot;Plots&quot;&#41;</code>) and setting the <code>plotly</code> backend:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">using Plots
plotly()</pre>
<pre class="output">
Plots.PlotlyBackend()</pre>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<div class="markdown"><p>The <code>plotly</code> backend is part of the <code>Plots</code> package. Other backends require installation. Some others are <code>pyplot</code>, for the <code>PyPlot</code> package; <code>gr</code>, for the <code>GR</code> package, <code>plotlyjs</code>, for an enhanced Plotly backend through <code>PlotlyJS</code>.</p>
</div> 
</div>
<p>With <code>Plots</code>, it is very easy to graph a function.</p><p>For example, to graph $f(x) = 1 - x^2/2$ over the interval $[-3,3]$ we have:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = 1 - x^2/2
plot(f, -3, 3)</pre>

<p>The <code>plot</code> command does the hard work behind the scenes. It needs 2 pieces of information:</p><ul>
<li><p>what to plot. With this invocation, this detail is expressed by passing a function object to <code>plot</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>where to plot. As with a sketch, it is impossible in this case to render a graph with all possible $x$ values in the domain of $f$, so we need to pick some viewing window. In the example this is $[-3,3]$ which is expressed by passing the two endpoints as the second and third arguments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Plotting a function is then this simple: <code>plot&#40;f, a, b&#41;</code>.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>A basic template:</em> Many operations we meet will take the form <code>action&#40;function, args...&#41;</code>, as the call to <code>plot</code> does. The template shifts the focus to the action to be performed. This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative</a> style, where the details to execute the action are only exposed as needed.</p>
</blockquote><p>To see some other graphs, we can plot the <code>sin</code> function over one period with:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">plot(sin, 0, 2pi)</pre>

<p>Though this graph shows the asymptote structure and periodicity, it doesn't give much insight into each period or even into the fact that the function is periodic.</p><h2>The details of graph making</h2><p>The actual details of making a graph of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are pretty simple and follow the steps in making a "T"-table:</p><ul>
<li><p>A set of $x$ values are created between $a$ and $b$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A corresponding set of $y$ values are created.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The pairs $(x,y)$ are plotted as points and connected with straight lines.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The only real difference is that when drawing by hand, we might know to curve the lines connecting points based on an analysis of the function. As <code>Julia</code> doesn't consider this, the points are connected with straight lines like a dot-to-dot puzzle.</p><p>We can use <code>linspace</code> to create the $x$ values and broadcasting to create the $y$ values.</p><p>For example, if we were to plot $f(x) = \sin(x)$ over $[0,2\pi]$ using $10$ points, we might do:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = sin(x)
xs = linspace(0, 2pi, 10)  # add 10, as default is higher
ys = f.(xs)</pre>
<pre class="output">
10-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.0        
  0.642788   
  0.984808   
  0.866025

 -0.866025   
 -0.984808   
 -0.642788   
 -2.44929e-16</pre>

<p>This plots the points as pairs and then connects them in order using straight lines. Basically, it creates a dot-to-dot graph. The above graph looks primitive, as it doesn't utilize enought points. A solution might be to just use more than 10 points. In <code>Plots</code> an algorithm is utilized that adds more points when the function is more "curvy" and otherwise uses fewer points.</p><h4>NaN values</h4><p>At times it is not desirable to draw lines between each succesive point. For example, if there is a discontinuity in the function or if there were a vertical asymptote, such as what happens at $0$ with $1/x$. There is a convention that if the $y$ value for a point is <code>NaN</code> that no lines will connect. This is convenient in many cases, though not with $1/x$ as <code>1/0</code> is <code>Inf</code> and not <code>NaN</code>. (Unlike <code>0/0</code> which is NaN.</p><p>Here is one way to plot $f(x) = 1/x$ over $[-1,1]$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = 1/x
xs = linspace(-1, 1, 251)
ys = map(f, xs)

<h5>Example: Reflections</h5><p>The graph of a function may be reflected through a line, as those seen with a mirror. For example, a reflection through the $y$ axis takes a point $(x,y)$ to the point $(-x, y)$. We can easily see this graphically, when we have sets of $x$ and $y$ values through a judiciously placed minus sign.</p><p>For example, to plot $\sin(x)$ over $(-\pi,\pi)$ we might do:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">xs = linspace(-pi, pi)
ys = sin.(xs)
plot(xs, ys)</pre>

<p>Looking carefully we see there is a difference. (How?)</p><p>There are four common reflections discussed:</p><ul>
<li><p>reflection through the $y$-axis takes $(x,y)$ to $(-x, y)$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>reflection through the $x$-axis takes $(x,y)$ to $(x, -y)$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>reflection through the origin takes $(x,y)$ to $(-x, -y)$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>reflection through the line $y=x$ takes $(x,y)$ to $(y,x)$.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For the $\sin(x)$ graph, we see that reflecting through the $x$ axis produces the same graph as reflecting through the $y$ axis:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">plot(xs, -ys)</pre>

<p>The graph is that of the "inverse function" for $\sin(x), x \text{ in } [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. </p><h2>Layers</h2><p>Graphing more than one function over the same viewing window is often desirable. This is easily done in <code>Plots</code> by specifying a vector of functions as the first argument to <code>plot</code> instead of a single function object. The notation is <code>&#91;f1, f2, ..., fn&#93;</code>. For example, to see that the polynomial and the cosine function are "close" near $0$, we can plot <em>both</em> $\cos(x)$ and the function $f(x) = 1 - x^2/2$ over $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = 1 - x^2/2
plot([cos, f], -pi/2, pi/2)</pre>

<p>The 3 main functions for adding layers are:</p><ul>
<li><p><code>plot&#33;&#40;f&#41;</code> or <code>plot&#33;&#40;f, a, b&#41;</code> to add the graph of the function <code>f</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>scatter&#33;&#40;xs, ys&#41;</code> to add points $(xs_1, ys_1), (xs_2, ys_2), \dots$.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>annotate&#33;&#40;&#40;x,y, label&#41;&#41;</code> to add a label at $(x,y)$</p>
</li>
</ul><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<div class="markdown"><p>Julia has a convention to use functions named with a <code>&#33;</code> suffix to indicate that they mutate some object. In this case, the object is the current graph, though it is implicit. Both <code>plot&#33;</code>, <code>scatter&#33;</code>, and <code>annotate&#33;</code> (others too) do this by adding a layer.</p>
</div> 
</div>
<h3>Additional arguments to modify a graphic</h3><p>The <code>Plots</code> package provides many arguments for modifying a graphic, here we mention just a few:</p><ul>
<li><p><code>plot&#40;..., title&#61;&quot;main title&quot;, xlab&#61;&quot;x axis label&quot;, ylab&#61;&quot;y axis label&quot;&#41;</code>: add title and label information to a graphic</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>plot&#40;..., color&#61;&quot;green&quot;&#41;</code>: this argument can be used to adjust the color of the drawn figure (color can be a string or symbol)</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>plot&#40;..., linewidth&#61;5&#41;</code>: this argument can be used to adjust the width of drawn lines</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>plot&#40;..., xlims&#61;&#40;a,b&#41;, ylims&#61;&#40;c,d&#41;</code>: either or both <code>xlims</code> and <code>ylims</code> can be used to control the viewing window</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>plot&#40;..., legend&#61;false&#41;</code>: by default, different layers will be indicated with a legend, this will turn off this feature</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For plotting points with <code>scatter</code> or <code>scatter&#33;</code> the markers can be adjusted via</p><ul>
<li><p><code>scatter&#40;..., markersize&#61;5&#41;</code>: increase marker size</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>scatter&#40;..., marker&#61;:square&#41;</code>: change the marker (uses a symbol, not a string to specify)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Of course, zero, one or more of these can be used on any given call to <code>plot</code>, <code>plot&#33;</code>, <code>scatter</code> or <code>scatter&#33;</code>.</p><h2>Parametric graphs</h2><p>If we have two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ there are a few ways to investigate their joint behaviour. As just mentioned, we can graph both $f$ and $g$ over the same interval by passing the vector of functions <code>&#91;f,g&#93;</code> to <code>plot</code>. Such a graph allows an easy comparison of the shape of the two functions and can be useful in solving $f(x) = g(x)$. For the latter, the graph of $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ is also of value: solutions to $f(x)=g(x)$ appear as crossing points on the graph of <code>&#91;f,g&#93;</code>, whereas they appear as zeros (crossings of the $x$-axis) when <code>h</code> is plotted.</p><p>A different graph can be made to compare the two side-by-side. This is a parametric plot. Rather than plotting points $(x,f(x))$ and $(x,g(x))$ with two separate graphs, the graph consists of points $(f(x), g(x))$. We illustrate with some examples below:</p><h5>Example</h5><p>The most "famous" parametric graph is one we are already familiar with, as it follows the parametrization of points on the unit circle by the angle, which we denote by <code>x</code>:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = cos(x); g(x) = sin(x)
xs = linspace(0, 2pi)
plot(f.(xs), g.(xs))</pre>

<p>Any point $(a,b)$ on this graph is represented by $(\cos(x), \sin(x))$ for some value of $x$, and in fact multiple values of $x$, since $x + 2k\pi$ will produce the same $(a,b)$ value as $x$ will.</p><p>Making the parametric plot is similar to creating a plot using lower level commands. There is a function to generate a sequence of value to approximate the $x$ values used (<code>xs</code>), a set of commands to create the corresponding function values (e.g., <code>map&#40;f,xs&#41;</code>), and some instruction on how to represent the values, in this case with lines connecting the points.</p><p>There is a convenience interface for these plots – just pass the two functions in:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">plot(f, g, 0, 2pi)</pre>

<p>In this graph, as $f(x)/g(x) = x$, as $x$ gets large, the ratio stays reasonable.</p><h5>Example</h5><p>Parametric plots are useful to compare the ratio of values near a point. In the above example, we see how this is helpful for large <code>x</code>. This example shows it is convenient for a fixed <code>x</code>, in this case <code>x&#61;0</code>.</p><p>Plot $g(x) = x - \sin(x)$ and $g(x) = x^3$ around $x=0$:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">g(x) = x - sin(x)

<p>This graph is <em>nearly</em> a straight line. At the point $(0,0)=(g(0), f(0))$, we see that both functions are behaving in a similar manner, though the slope is not $1$, so they do not increase at exactly the same rate.</p><h5>Example: Etch A Sketch</h5><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch">Etch A sketch</a> is a drawing toy where a two knobs control the motion of a pointer, one knob controlling the $x$ motion, the other the $y$ motion. The trace of the movement of the pointer is recorded until the display is cleared by shaking. Shake to clear is now a motion incorporated by some smart-phone apps.</p><p>Playing with the toy makes a few things become clear:</p><ul>
<li><p>Twisting just the left knob (the horizontal or $x$ motion) will move the pointer left or right, leaving a horizontal line. Parametrically, this would follow the equations $g(t) = \xi(t)$ for some $\xi$ and $f(t) = 0$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Twisting just the right knob (the vertical or $y$ motion) will move the pointer up or down, leaving a vertical line.  Parametrically, this would follow the equations $g(t) = 0$  and $f(t) = \psi(t)$ for some $\psi$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drawing a line with a slope different from $0$ or $\infty$ requires moving both knobs at the same time. A 45$^\circ$ line with slope $m=1$ can be made by twisting both at the same rate, say through $g(t) = ct$, $f(t)=ct$. It doesn't matter how big $c$ is, just that it is the same for both $g$ and $f$. Creating a different slope is done by twisting at different rates, say $g(t)=ct$ and $f(t)=dt$. The slope of the resulting line will be $d/c$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drawing a curve is done by twisting the two knobs with varying rates.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These all apply to parametric plots, as the Etch A Sketch trace is no more than a plot of $(g(t), f(t))$ over some range of values for $t$, where $g$ describes the movement in time of the left knob and $f$ the movement in time of the right.</p><p>Now, thinking about the last problem in the context of this, we saw in the last problem that the parametric graph was nearly a line – so close the eye can't really tell otherwise. That means that the rates of change in $t$ of both $g(t)=t - \sin(t)$ and $f(t) = t^3$ for $t$ around $0$ are in a nearly fixed ratio, as otherwise the graph would have a curve in it.</p><h5>Example: Spirograph</h5><p>Parametric plots can describe a richer set of curves than can plots of functions. Plots of functions must pass the "vertical-line test", as there can be at most one $y$ value for a given $x$ value. This is not so for parametric plots, as the circle example above shows. Plotting sines and cosines this way is the basis for the popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">Spirograph</a> toy. The curves drawn there are parametric plots where the functions come from rolling a smaller disc either around the outside or inside of a larger disc.</p><p>Here is an example using a parameterization provided on the Wikipedia page where $R$ is the radius of the larger disc, $r$ the radius of the smaller disc and $\rho < r$ indicating the position of the pencil within the smaller disc.</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">R, r, rho = 1, 1/4, 1/4
g(t) = (R-r) * cos(t) + rho * cos((R-r)/r * t)
f(t) = (R-r) * sin(t) - rho * sin((R-r)/r * t)

plot(g, f, 0, max((R-r)/r, r/(R-r))*2pi)</pre>

<h6>Question</h6><p>The <em>viewport</em> of a graph is the $x$-$y$ range of the viewing window. By default, the $y$-part of the viewport is determined by the range of the function over the specified interval $[a,b]$. For some functions this can produce poor graphs, especially when there is a vertical asymptote. Here are two ways to restrict this with <code>Plots</code>:</p><ul>
<li><p>Add an argument <code>ylim &#61; &#40;m, M&#41;</code> where <code>m</code> and <code>M</code> are the min and maximum of the range you wish to show.</p>
</li>
<li><p>trim the $y$ values returned by the function so that if they are bigger than 10, say, they are not shown. For this, a function like following can be useful:</p>
</li>
</ul><pre class="sourceCode julia">trim(f; c=10) =  x -> abs(f(x)) > c ? NaN : f(x)</pre>
<pre class="output">
trim (generic function with 1 method)</pre>

<p>The latter might be used as follows:</p><pre class="sourceCode julia">f(x) = 1/x
plot(trim(f), -1,1)</pre>
