# Trigonometric functions

The trigonometric functions are used to describe relationships between triangles, circles and oscillatory motions. With such a wide range of utility is no wonder that they pop up in many places and their [origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#History) date to Hipparcus and Ptolemy over 2000 years ago.

This section gives a quick overview of some topics related to the trigonometric functions.

## The 6 basic trigonometric functions

For a right triangle with angles $\theta$, $\pi/2 - \theta$ and $\pi/2$ we call the side opposite $\theta$ the "opposite" side, the shorter adjacent side the "adjacent" side and the longer adjacent side the hypotenuse. With these, the basic definitions for the primary trigonometric functions are $~ \begin{align} \sin(\theta) &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} &\quad(\text{the sine function})\\
\cos(\theta) &= \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} &\quad(\text{the cosine function})\\
\tan(\theta) &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}.  &\quad(\text{the tangent function}) \end{align} ~$ <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <div class="markdown"><p>Many students remember these through <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SOHCAHTOA.html">SOH-CAH-TOA</a>.</p> </div>  </div>

Some algebra shows that $\tan(\theta) = \sin(\theta)/\cos(\theta)$. There are also 3 reciprocal functions, the cosecant, secant and cotangent.

These definitions in terms of sides only apply for $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2$. More generally, if we relate any angle taken in the counter clockwise direction for the $x$-axis with a point $(x,y)$ on the *unit* circle, then we can extend these definitions â€“ the point $(x,y)$ is also $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$.

The fact that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ for the unit circle leads to the "Pythagorean identity" for trigonometric functions: $~ \sin(\theta)^2 + \cos(\theta)^2 = 1. ~$

This basic fact can be manipulated many ways. For example, dividing through by $\cos(\theta)^2$ gives the related identity: $\tan(\theta)^2 + 1 = \sec(\theta)^2$.

### The trigonometric functions in Julia

Julia has the 6 basic trigonometric functions defined through the functions `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `csc`, `sec`, and `cot`.

With some basic trigonometry, exact values can be derived for specific angles. In particular, the following values are usually committed to memory: $~ \begin{align} \sin(0) &= 0, \quad \sin(\pi/6) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \sin(\pi/4) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad\sin(\pi/3) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\text{ and } \sin(\pi/2) = 1\\
\cos(0) &= 1, \quad \cos(\pi/6) =  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \cos(\pi/4) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad\cos(\pi/3) = \frac{1}{2},\text{ and } \cos(\pi/2) = 0. \end{align} ~$

However, `Julia`'s functions can compute values for any angles, including these:

```{r eval=FALSE}
[sin(theta) for theta in [0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2]]




```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}
## 5-element Array{Float64,1}:
##  0.0     
##  0.5     
##  0.707107
##  0.866025
##  1.0     
```



```{r eval=FALSE}

##  0.5     
##  0.707107

```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}

##  1.0     


```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}
## 5-element Array{Float64,1}:
##  0.0     
##  0.5     
##  0.707107
##  0.866025
##  1.0     



```
                                    

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <div class="markdown"><p>For really large values, round off error can play a big role. For example, the <em>exact</em> value of $\sin(1000000 \pi)$ is $0$, but the returned value is not quite $0$ <code>sin&#40;1_000_000 * pi&#41; &#61; -2.231912181360871e-10</code>. For exact multiples of $\pi$ with large multiples the <code>sinpi</code> and  <code>cospi</code> functions are useful.</p> <p>(Both functions are computed by first employing periodicity to reduce the problem to a smaller angle. However, for large multiples the floating-point roundoff becomes a problem.)</p> </div>  </div>

### Basic properties

The sine function is defined for all real $\theta$ and has a range of $[-1,1]$. Clearly as $\theta$ winds around the $x$-axis, the position of the $y$ coordinate begins to repeat itself. We say the sine function is *periodic* with period $2\pi$. A graph will illustrate:

```{r eval=FALSE}
using Plots
plot(sin, 0, 4pi)

The graph shows two periods. The wavy aspect of the graph is why this function is used to model periodic motions, such as the amount of sunlight in a day, or the alternating current powering a computer.

From this graph â€“ or considering when the $y$ coordinate is $0$ â€“ we see that the sine function has zeros at any integer multiple of $\pi$, or $k\pi$, $k$ in $\dots,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$.

The cosine function is similar, in that it has the same domain and range, but is "out of phase" with the sine curve. A graph of both shows the two are related:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot([sin, cos], 0, 4pi)

The cosine function is just a shift of the sine function (or vice versa). We see that the zeros of the cosine function happen at points of the form $\pi/2 + k\pi$, $k$ in $\dots,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$.

The tangent function does not have all $\theta$ for its domain, rather those points where division by $0$ occurs are excluded. These occur when the cosine is $0$, or again at $\pi/2 + k\pi$, $k$ in $\dots,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$. The range of the tangent function will be all real $y$.

The tangent function is also periodic, but not with period $2\pi$, but rather just $\pi$. A graph will show this. Here we trim the graph to avoid the impact of the vertical asymptotes at the zeros of the cosine function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
trim(f, c=20) = x -> abs(f(x)) > c ? NaN : f(x)
plot(trim(tan), -2pi, 2pi)

### Functions using degrees

Trigonometric function are functions of angles which have two common descriptions: in terms of degrees or radians. Degrees are common when right triangles are considered, radians much more common in general, as the relationship with arc-length holds in that $r\theta = l$, where $r$ is the radius of a circle and $l$ the length of the arc formed by angle $\theta$.

The two are related, as a circle of $2\pi$ radians and 360 degrees. So to convert from degrees into radians it takes multiplying by $2\pi/360$ and to convert from radians to degrees it takes multiplying by $360/(2\pi)$. The `deg2rad` and `rad2deg` functions will happily do this.

In `Julia`, the functions `sind`, `cosd`, `tand`, `cscd`, `secd`, and `cotd` are available to simplify the task of composing the two operations (that is `sin(deg2rad(x))` is the same as `sind(x)`).

## The sum-and-difference formulas

Consider the point on the unit circle $(x,y) = (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$. In terms of $(x,y)$ (or $\theta$) is there a way to represent the angle found by rotating an additional $\theta$, that is what is $(\cos(2\theta), \sin(2\theta))$?

More generally, suppose we have two angles $\alpha and $\beta$, can we represent the values of $(\cos(\alpha + \beta), \sin(\alpha + \beta))$ using the values just involving $\beta$ and :\alpha separately?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#Identities) the following figure (from [mathalino.com](http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/derivation-of-formulas/derivation-of-sum-and-difference-of-two-angles)) has ideas that date to Ptolemy:

!["Geometric picture"](http://www.mathalino.com/sites/default/files/users/Mathalino/summary-sum-and-difference-of-two-angles.jpg)

This shows that $~ \begin{align} \sin(\alpha + \beta) &= \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha)\\
\cos(\alpha + \beta) &= \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta). \end{align} ~$

Using the fact that $\sin$ is an odd function and $\cos$ an even function, related formulas for $\alpha - \beta$ can be derived.

Taking $\alpha = \beta$ we immediately get the "double-angle" formulas: $~ \begin{align} \sin(2\alpha) &= 2\sin(\alpha)\cos(\alpha)\\
\cos(2\alpha) &= \cos(\alpha)^2 - \sin(\alpha)^2. \end{align} ~$

The latter looks like the Pythagorean identify, but has a minus sign. In fact, the Pythagorean identify is often used to rewrite this, for example $\cos(2\alpha) = 2\cos(\alpha)^2 - 1$ of $1 - 2\sin(\alpha)^2$.

Applying the above with $\alpha = \beta/2$, we get that $\cos(\beta) = 2\cos(\beta/2)^2 -1$, which rearranged yields the "half-angle" formula: $\cos(\beta/2)^2 = (1 + \cos(\beta))/2$.

##### Example

Consider the expressions $\cos((n+1)\theta)$ and $\cos((n-1)\theta)$. These can be re-expressed as: $~ \begin{align} \cos((n+1)\theta) &= \cos(n\theta + \theta) = \cos(n\theta) \cos(\theta) - \sin(n\theta)\sin(\theta), \text{ and}\\
\cos((n-1)\theta) &= \cos(n\theta - \theta) = \cos(n\theta) \cos(-\theta) - \sin(n\theta)\sin(-\theta). \end{align} ~$

But $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$, whereas $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$. Using this, we add the two formulas above to get: $~ \cos((n+1)\theta) = 2\cos(n\theta) \cos(\theta)  - \cos((n-1)\theta). ~$

That is the angle for a multiple of $n+1$ can be expressed in terms of the angle with a multiple of $n$ and $n-1$. This can be used recursively to find expressions for $\cos(n\theta)$ in terms of polynomials in $\cos(\theta)$.

## Inverse trigonometric functions

The  trigonometric functions are all periodic. In particular they are not monotonic over their entire domain. This means there is no *inverse* function applicable. However, by restricting the domain to where the functions are monotonic, inverse functions can be defined:

  * For $\sin(x)$, the restricted domain of $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ allows for the arcsine function to be defined. In `Julia` this is implemented with `asin`.
  * For $\cos(x)$, the restricted domain of $[0,\pi]$ allows for the arccosine function to be defined. In `Julia` this is implemented with `acos`.
  * For $\tan(x)$, the restricted domain of $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ allows for the arctangent function to be defined. In `Julia` this is implemented with `atan`.

For example, the arcsine function is defined for $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ and has a range of $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(asin, -1, 1)

The horizontal asymptotes are $y=\pi/2$ and $y=-\pi/2$.

### Implications of a restricted domain

Notice that $\sin(\arcsin(x)) = x$ for any $x$ in $[-1,1]$, but, of course,  not for all $x$, as the output of the sine function can't be arbitrarily large.

However, $\arcsin(\sin(x))$ is defined for all $x$, but only equals $x$ when $x$ is in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. The output, or range, of the $\arcsin$ function is restricted to that interval.

This can be limiting at times. A common case is to find the angle in $[0, 2\pi)$ corresponding to a point $(x,y)$. In the simplest case (the first and fourth quadrants) this is just given by $\arctan(y/x)$. But with some work, the correct angle can be found for any pair $(x,y)$. As this is a common desire, the `atan2` function is available. This function returns a value in $(-\pi, \pi]$.

For example, this will not give back $\theta$ without more work to identify the quadrant:

```{r eval=FALSE}
theta = 3pi/4                     # 2.35619...
x,y = (cos(theta), sin(theta))    # -0.7071..., 0.7071...
atan(y/x)




```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}
## -0.7853981633974484
```



```{r eval=FALSE}
## -0.7853981633974484

```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}
## -0.7853981633974484


```
                                    

But,

```{r eval=FALSE}
atan2(y,x)




```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}
## 2.356194490192345
```



```{r eval=FALSE}
## 2.356194490192345

```
                                    

```{r eval=FALSE}
## 2.356194490192345


```
                                    

##### Example: The Chebyshev Polynomials

Consider again this equation derived with the sum-and-difference formula: $~ \cos((n+1)\theta) = 2\cos(n\theta) \cos(\theta)  - \cos((n-1)\theta). ~$

Let $T_n(x) = \cos(n \arccos(x))$. Calling $\theta = \arccos(x)$ we get a relation between these functions: $~ T_{n+1}(x) = 2x T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x). ~$

We can simplify a few: For example, when $n=0$ we see immediately that $T_0(x) = 1$, the constant function. Whereas with $n=1$ we get $T_1(x) = \cos(\arccos(x)) = x$. Things get more interesting as we get bigger $n$, for example using the equation above we get $T_2(x) = 2xT_1(x) - T_0(x) = 2x\cdot x - 1 = 2x^2 - 1$. Continuing, we'd get $T_3(x) = 2 x T_2(x) - T_1(x) = 2x(2x^2 - 1) - x = 4x^3 -3x$.

A few things become clear from the above two representations:

  * Starting from $T_0(x) = 1$ and $T_1(x)=x$ and using the recursive defintion of $T_{n+1}$ we get a family of polynomials where $T_n(x)$ is a degree $n$ polynomial. These are defined for all $x$, not just $-1 \leq x \leq 1$.
  * Using the initial definition, we see that the zeros of $T_n(x)$ all occur within $[-1,1]$ and happen when $n\arccos(x) = k\pi + \pi/2$, or $x=\cos((2k+1)/n \cdot \pi/2)$ for $k=0, 1, \dots, n-1$.

Other properties of this polynomial family are not at all obvious. One is that amongst all polynomials of degree $n$ with roots in $[-1,1]$, $T_n(x)$ will be the smallest in magnitude (after we divide by the leading coefficient to make all polynomials considered to be monic). We can check this for one case. Take $n=4$, then we have: $T_4(x) = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1$. Compare this with $p(x) = (x+3/5)(x+1/5)(x-1/5)(x-3/5)$ (evenly spaced zeros):

```{r eval=FALSE}
T4(x) = (8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1) / 8 
p(x) = (x+3/5)*(x+1/5)*(x-1/5)*(x-3/5) 
plot([x -> abs(T4(x)), x -> abs(p(x))], -1,1)

## Hyperbolic trigonometric functions

Related to the trigonometric functions are the hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Instead of associating a point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle with an angle $\theta$, we associate a point $(x,y)$ on the unit *hyperbola* (with $x^2 - y^2 = 1$. We define the hyperbolic sin ($\sinh$) and hyperbolic cosine ($\cosh$) through $(\cosh(\theta), \sinh(\theta)) = (x,y)$.

These can be expressed using the exponential function as: $~ \begin{align} \sinh(x) &= \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}\\
\cosh(x) &= \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}. \end{align} ~$

The hyperbolic tangent is then the ratio of $\sinh$ and $\cosh$. As well, three inverse hyperbolic functions can be defined.

###### Question

A formula due to [Bhaskara I](http://tinyurl.com/k89ux5q) dates to around 650AD and gives a rational function approximation to the sine function. In degrees, we have $~ \sin(x^\circ) \approx \frac{4x(180-x)}{40500 - x(180-x)}, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 180. ~$

Plot both functions over $[0, 180]$. What is the maximum difference between the two to two decimal points? (You may need to plot the difference of the functions to read off an approximate answer.)
