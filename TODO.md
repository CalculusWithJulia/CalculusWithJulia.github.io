# (PART) The derivative of a function {-}
for Rbookdown




# v0.6

✓ QuadGK
✓ SymPy fix
bookdown prot
✓ Roots and polynomials

✓ - finish up
- trig integrals?
✓ - polar coordinates

✓ Nice historical problems here http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fc-2016-05



## TODO

### general


### precalc

* (numbers_types) Add: truncation, .9bar and 1,
  ... http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/#background-and-references


* normal odd floats: https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/thats-not-normalthe-performance-of-odd-floats/

* transformations: more read the graph like problems.

* Wehre to put in inverse functions?

* more grpahing problems...



### limits

* continuity section is underwhelming...

### derivatives

* implicit differentiation needs problems!!!

### integration


### ODEs

Add bit on ODEs, simple ones; Euler's method


--> This is phase 2 and *only* if phase 1 gains any traction <--

### series

ALL

### Vector calc

ALL
