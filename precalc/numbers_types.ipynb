      "<p>An important algebraic property of a set of numbers and an operation on them is _closure_. That is, if you take an operation like <code>+</code> and add two numbers in a set, will that result also be in the set? If so for any pair of numbers, then the set is closed with respect to addition. For the even numbers, the answer is yes and for the odd numbers, false (as, the sum of any two odd numbers is even, for example, $3+3=6$). If we start with the _natural numbers_, then it is closed under addition, However, if you think of subtraction as the operation, then the natural numbers are not closed under subtraction, as, for example, $1 - 2 = -1$. The integers are closed under addition and subtraction, as well multiplication. That being said, once we look at division, closure is no longer the case for the integers, as, for example $1/2$ is not an integer. Before talking about the rational numbers, which are closed by division \u2013 as long as we don't try to divide by 0, we note that there are other ideas of division of integers. The _division algorithm_ (XXX ref) allows one to write any division, $a/b$ as $a = mb + r$, where $0 \\leq r < b$. The value $r$ is the _remainder_. Here both $m$ and $r$ are integers.</p>"

For postive, rational powers, like $p^{1/n}$ a reference to these as solutions to $x^n=p$ is used. With that, we can define values of $p^{m/n}$ as $(p^m)^{1/n}$, so defining the value is possible. However, values satisfying $x^2=2$ are not rational, so the operation <code>^</code> is not closed for the rational numbers. For closure under powers, the real numbers are needed provided we restrict to $p \\geq 0$ and complex numbers are needed if we allow $p$ to be negative (e.g., $(-1)^{1/2}$ is the definition of $i$, the imaginary unit.</p>"
