# Usages of unicode symbols


`Julia` allows the use of *unicode* symbols to replace variable names and for function calls. Unicode operations are entered in this pattern `\name[tab]`. That is a slase, `\`, the name (e.g., `alpha`), and then a press of the `tab` key.

In these notes, the following may appear as variable or function names

| `\Name`          | Symbol | Usage notes                     |
|:---------------- |:------ |:------------------------------- |
| `\euler`         | `ℯ`    | The variable `e`                |
| `\pi`            | `π`    |                                 |
| `\alpha`         | `α`    |                                 |
| `\beta`          | `β`    |                                 |
| `\delta`         | `δ`    |                                 |
| `\Delta`         | `Δ`    | Change, as in `Δx`              |
| `\gamma`         | `γ`    |                                 |
| `\phi`           | `ϕ`    |                                 |
| `\Phi`           | `Φ`    | Used for parameterized surfaces |
| `x\_1`           | `x₁`   | Subscripts                      |
| `r\vec`          | `r⃗`   | Vector annotation               |
| `T\hat`          | `T̂`    | Unit vector annotation          |

The following are associated with derivatives

| `\Name`          | Symbol | Usage notes                     |
|:---------------- |:------ |:------------------------------- |
| `\partial`       | `∂`    |                                 |
| `\nabla`         | `∇`    | del operator in CwJ package     |

The following are *infix* operators

| `\Name`          | Symbol | Usage notes                     |
|:---------------- |:------ |:------------------------------- |
| `\circ`          | `∘`    | composition                     |
| `\cdot`          | `⋅`    | dot product                     |
| `\times`         | `×`    | cross product                   |

Infix operators may need parentheses due to precedence rules. For example, to call a composition, one needs `(f ∘ g)(x)` so that composition happens before function evaluation (`g(x)`).
